 * Microsoft Clarity — heatmaps + session recordings.
 * Each store has its OWN Clarity project, set per-deployment through
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_ID (a build arg in Dokploy). There is deliberately no
 * default: a tenant deployed without an id records nothing, rather than
 * silently mixing its sessions into another store's project.
 * Each deployment MUST have its own project id — reusing another store's id
 * mixes two shops' session recordings into one dashboard.
