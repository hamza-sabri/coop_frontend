 * LINE total and the SALE total have to be typeable where they are read. The
 * part that is easy to get wrong is the record: `unit_price` alone cannot
 * distinguish "sold at ₪1 because that is the price" from "sold at ₪1 because
 * the cashier decided so". The catalogue price has to travel with the sale.
