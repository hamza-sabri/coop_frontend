/**
 * The till is worked from a keyboard and a barcode gun, not a mouse.
 *
 * Three things the cashier does constantly, each of which used to fail:
 *
 *   Type a haggled price, hit Enter. The amount used to be committed only by
 *   the BLUR handler, so whether it survived depended on the order two
 *   handlers happened to run in — she could ring the OLD price with the new
 *   one still on screen.
 *
 *   Scan an item, press + to make it two. The page-level +/− handler bails out
 *   the moment any field has focus — and a scan focuses the quantity field, so
 *   + did nothing at exactly the moment it was wanted.
 *
 *   F2 to finish AND print. A function key, so unlike Enter it is unambiguous
 *   mid-typing; it is handled once, globally.
