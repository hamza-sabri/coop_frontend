/**
 * One toast per checkout.
 *
 * A sale used to raise two: "تم البيع — ₪163.00" and, a beat later, a second
 * about the receipt. Two stacked toasts for one action read as two things
 * having happened, and the cashier has to parse both while a customer waits.
 *
 * These assert the source, because the alternative is mounting the whole POS.
 * They are cheap and they pin the exact properties that regressed.
