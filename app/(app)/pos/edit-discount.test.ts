/**
 * The amount a corrected invoice charges.
 *
 * A correction opens with the amount the original sale was SETTLED at, so
 * reopening a ₪90-on-₪100 invoice to fix a customer's name does not silently
 * re-charge the full ₪100.
 *
 * That pin has to let go the moment the LINES change. It did not: an invoice
 * agreed at ₪10.00 for one item was edited to eight items worth ₪120.99 and
 * still charged ₪10.00 — an undercharge of ₪111 with nothing on screen saying
 * so, and a history panel showing "الإجمالي وقتها ₪10.00" above lines that
 * plainly added up to more.
