/**
 * A product is always added to the cart as a single PIECE.
 *
 * The bug: scanning a ₪1 chocolate bar opened "اختر النوع" listing only
 * "عبوة ×24 — ₪24.00" (twice, because the import makes one variant per pack
 * BARCODE and this product had two). There was no way to say "just one", so
 * the sale stopped dead at the till.
 *
 * Every variant in this store is a PACK created by the Shamel import from its
 * secondary selling units — not a colour or a size. So the base product is
 * always a valid answer and is the right default; the pack is the exception,
 * reachable from the النوع column after the fact.
