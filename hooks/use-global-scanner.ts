 * Global keyboard-wedge listener: a hardware barcode scanner "types" the code
 * as a fast keystroke burst ending in Enter. This captures that burst anywhere
 * on the page — the cashier never has to click into the search box first.
 *
 * It stays out of the way of normal typing:
 *  - if the user is focused in a text field (search box, a form input, a
 *    textarea), the field handles the keys itself and we do nothing;
 *  - only FAST bursts (scanner speed) that end in Enter fire the callback, so
 *    ordinary key presses on the page never trigger it.
