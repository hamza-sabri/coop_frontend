 * showed each other's open baskets, and closed carts came back from copies
 * nobody could see.

 * did not create is worth a great deal of trouble. So the feature is gone
 * rather than guarded: with nothing to write to and nothing to read from,
 * there is no channel left for a cart to travel down.
